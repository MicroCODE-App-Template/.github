ISSUE_TEMPLATE

The markdown in the .github root directory are seen and selectable in GitHub for imitial Issue creation. But in a PRIVATE Organization--which app-template is--they must appear in the .github folder of **every repo in the org**.

So, these are cloned from app-template/.github into every other repo, but the ones in ORG Root are the 'masters'.

The markdown in the other sub-folders are for Devs to use while designing and implementing a correction or new feature.
