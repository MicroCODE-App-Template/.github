Suggestion: Duluth YC and others do a lot of pursuit races. I have played around a bit with the ORC Scoring program and it uses a single starting time for a division then applies a starting time offset in seconds to get the actual starting time for each section applied to each boat as it is entered into the competitors list for a race. For pursuit races the starting time offsets could reflect each boat’s individually assigned starting time. This would simplify calculation of elapsed times.
