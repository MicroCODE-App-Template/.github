For the vast majority of the imputed handicap analyses we perform, we do not need nor use all the information that Carl suggests. I have attached an example of the standard imputed handicap, which is based on what US PHRF requires for national appeals.
[Timothy McGuire] Thank you I’ll make this a standard output.

For the majority of imputed handicap calculations we only need course length, boat name, boat type, sail number, and elapsed time. We enter the current LMPHRF handicaps and rescore the races using both time on distance and time on time. This is sufficient to tell us if the races are competitive and the boat is being well sailed. There are some situations where a do look at how a boat performs in different conditions. In those situations having the additional information about race conditions is useful.
[Timothy McGuire] The App’s output will include scoring under multiple systems, e.g., PHRF and ORC handicaps, wind-bands, and scores will be in the output.

Having a standard format for the sail number and the use of the MWPHRF assigned boat type is helpful. But we do include boats that do not have MWPHRF handicaps if we are able to estimate one. And we do include races run under other rating systems. CSV or Excel format is preferred - especially for the elapsed time values. PDF does not work.
[Timothy McGuire] I’ll output in CSV – widely support data format and very easy to write form App code.

It would be great if all races were scored using the same scoring program and all we would need to do is input the boat name or boat model and the system would show all races where that boat model competed in. One of the strong points in YachtScoring is that Performance page which lists all races for a specific boat that the scorer entered a distance value.
[Timothy McGuire] We are going to have a similar page that shows:

1. All race results for your BOAT,  ‘How am I doing this season?’
2. All race results for boats of your DESIGN,  ‘How am I doing against my sisterships?’
3. Your running SERIES and SEASON standings (a DRYA requirement the other systems do not support).
